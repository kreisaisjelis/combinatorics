A day in Anchuria can be either sunny or rainy. If the the weather today is different from weather yeasterday, anchurians say that today's weather is \textit{changed}. Anchurian scientists have estabilshed that 1st of January is always sunny, but every next day in January is sunny only if in the previous year the weather on that date was \textit{changed}. 

January of $2015$ was very diverse - weather changed a lot. What is the closest next year when the weather in January will be exactly the same as in $2015$?

At a certain mathematical conference, every pair of mathematicians are either friends or strangers. At mealtime, every participant eats in one of two large dining rooms. Each mathematician insists upon eating in a room which contains an even number of his or her friends. Prove that the number of ways that the mathematicians may be split between the two rooms is a power of two (i.e., is of the form $2^k$ for some positive integer $k$).

Let $S$ be a set of $n\ge 3$ points in the interior of a circle.

Show that there are three distinct points $a,b,c\in S$ and three distinct points $A,B,C$ on the circle such that $a$ is (strictly) closer to $A$ than any other point in $S$, $b$ is closer to $B$ than any other point in $S$ and $c$ is closer to $C$ than any other point in $S$.
Show that for no value of $n$ can four such points in $S$ (and corresponding points on the circle) be guaranteed.

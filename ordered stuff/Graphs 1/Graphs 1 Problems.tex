\begin{problem}
\textit{[Bridges of Königsberg]}
City of Königsberg is located on both sides of the river Pregel and on two islands. There are seven bridges connecting islands as shown on Figure \ref{fig:sevenBridges}. Leonhard Euler wants to take a walk that would take him across each bridge exactly once. Can he do this?

\begin{problem}
\textit{[Weird classmates]}
A student once told James: "We have $35$ students in our class. And imagine - everyone has exactly $11$ friends within the class!". James, being good at Graph Theory, imediately replied that this is not possible. How did he know?

\textit{[Road planning]}
In the Kingdom of Wakanda there are $15$ towns and each of these are connected with direct roads with no less than $7$ other towns within this Kingdom. Prove that its possible to travel by road between any two towns (possibly via other towns)!

\begin{problem}
\textit{[Forestry]}
A \textit{tree} is a set of nodes connected by sticks (each stick connecting exactly two nodes) where it is possible to travel between any two nodes (graph is connected), but it is not possible to travel somewhere and come back to original node not going though same stick twice (graph has no cycles).  A leaf is a node with just one stick connecting it. Prove that every tree has at least two leaves!

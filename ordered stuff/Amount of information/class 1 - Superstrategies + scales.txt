Intro to combinatorics (From Superstrategies)
Strategy = "an OOC hint to solving a problem"
"Expanding" a problem
	Bridge problem (hint - think of the slowest men)

Thinking outside the box
	3x3=4 dots (hint - lines can leave the grid; lines can be diagonal)
Reduction
	5x5=8 dots (hint - use reduction) 
	4x4=6, (hint - does painting 3x3 in different color help?)
	3x4=5
Thinking inside the box (aka, just trying)
	4x5=7 (thinking inside the box :) )

Simetrija
	Sultāna likums (hint - draw an x; consider the total amount of child births)
	Cik ir vidējais ģimenes izmērs arābijā (hint - joprojām simetrija)
Head and tails (assymetry disguised as symmetry)
	A: hhh pret hht - fair
	B: tth pret hhh - unfair
	C: hht pret tth - fair

Amount of information
	Goldsmith rumor problem (100 goldsmitsh year round, registered scale) 
		(hint: consider 1 artisan. Now 2 artisans...
		hint: how many results can an experiment have?
			)
	12 balls and balance scale. 1 oddball either lighter or heavier. Find it and say if its light or heavy		
		idea: set min cap (information theory) and guesstimate answer
		idea: elimination of branches (like not good to weigh 1vs1 on first)
		idea: (playing) gather info on smaller sets
		idea: groups can not stay independent (?)
		idea: you have to use all 3 results of experiment (count how many you need, if not)
		solution:
			4vs4 
				= weigh 3 suspect vs 3 normal
					= weigh last suspect with normal
					> weight 1 suspect vs 1 suspect (as you know the weight)
				> hhl vs hhl
					= remaining l vs l - easy
					> suspects - (hhl) weigh h vs h (uses all 3 results)
Extra: 
	line and shops model
	circle and shops model
Mājas darbs:
	7x7=12
	Atrast un atsūtīt man kādu labu "atjautības" uzdevumu 
		ar atrisinājumu un (galvenais) domāšanas stratēģiju, 
		kas palīdz to atrisināt
